# identityprovider
A minimal Identity Provider built in ASP.NET Core to explore and understand OAuth2 and OpenID Connect flows, including Authorization Code and On-Behalf-Of. This project simulates how real IdPs work, focusing on protocol mechanics, token generation, scopes, audiences, and secure delegation. Ideal for hands-on learning and experimentation.
